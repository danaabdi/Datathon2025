# 🛍️ Modecraft Ecommerce Data Analysis Project

## 📝 Project Overview
For the 6th DubsTech Datathon, we analyzed data from **Modecraft**, an ecommerce store offering various household items. The company sought insights from both **operational** and **marketing** perspectives to guide strategic decisions.

## 📙 Data Description

The dataset included over **500,000 order records** with the following columns:

- `InvoiceNo`: Unique Invoice ID  
- `StockCode`: Unique Product ID  
- `Description`: Product Name  
- `Quantity`: Total units purchased  
- `InvoiceDate`: Date and time of the invoice  
- `UnitPrice`: Price per unit (GBP)  
- `CustomerID`: Unique Customer ID  
- `Country`: Country of origin for the order

## 🗑️ Data Cleaning Process

### 🔍 Initial Assessment
- Reviewed dataset dimensions and structure
- Identified null values across key columns
- Ran summary statistics to understand distributions

### ➖ Handling Negative Values
- Removed negative `Quantity` values (likely returns)
- Documented the percentage of data removed

### ❓ Handling Missing Values
- Replaced null `CustomerID`s with `"Unknown Customer"`
- Replaced missing product descriptions with `"Unknown Product"`

### 🛠️ Feature Engineering
- Renamed `Description` to `Product Name` for clarity
- Extracted `Month` from `InvoiceDate`
- Added a `Season` column based on invoice month

### ✅ Final Verification
- Verified there were no remaining nulls
- Saved cleaned dataset for downstream analysis
